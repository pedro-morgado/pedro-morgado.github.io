abstract: "Audio-visual learning is a typical and challenging problem that aims to learn discriminative cross-modal correspondence for various audio-visual tasks, such as classification, localization, and source separation. Previous works often applied different frameworks with various objectives for each task separately. To unify audio-visual learning for different tasks, we present LSR, a simple yet effective approach that leverages the same framework for localization, separation, and recognition. Specifically, LSR leverages base correspondence localization to align the audio and visual features of base samples from the matched audio-visual pairs. Then the mixed audio separation objective is used to learn discriminative individual source representations from mixed audio. Finally, visual features corresponding to individual sources are separated from mixed images through the mixed visual alignment objective. Extensive experiments on MUSIC, VGG-Instruments, VGG-Music, and VGGSound-All datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our LSR in visual sound localization, sound separation, and nearest neighbor recognition."
